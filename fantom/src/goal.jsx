        Increase transparency: We believe that transparency is key to building trust with our donors. Therefore, we will leverage blockchain technology to provide a transparent and immutable ledger of all transactions made on our platform. Donors can easily track their donations and see how they are being used to support various charitable causes.

Lower transaction fees: Traditional payment methods often come with high transaction fees that eat into the amount that eventually reaches the charity. By using blockchain technology, we aim to reduce these fees and ensure that more of the donated funds go directly to the charities.

Expand our reach: We want to make charitable giving accessible to everyone, regardless of their location. With blockchain technology, we can reach donors and charities around the world, allowing us to make a greater impact on a global scale.
